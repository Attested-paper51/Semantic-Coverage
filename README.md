# Semantic Coverage - AI-Powered Test Quality Analysis

*Using LLMs to identify critical gaps in test coverage*

## The Problem
Traditional coverage metrics treat all code equally. 
Testing a print statement = testing core business logic.

## The Solution
An AI system that:
- Segments code into logical blocks (core functionality, error handling, etc.)
- Weights test coverage by criticality
- Identifies under-tested critical paths

## Technical Stack
- **LLMs**: GPT-4 for semantic segmentation
- **Python**: AST parsing, coverage.py integration
- **Testing**: Evaluated on 200+ functions across multiple projects

## Results
- Identified critical testing gaps in 76% of functions
- Outperformed traditional metrics in highlighting untested critical logic

### Option 2: Just the Paper (Still Good)
If you don't have time for the GitHub cleanup, submit the paper with a strong cover statement:
